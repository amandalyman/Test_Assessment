        My fianc√© and I have two dogs - Sir Lancelot and King Arthur. It is
        amazing how much of their personalities reflect us! Lance is laid back
        but has his moments of energy. Meanwhile, Arthur is super active and
        lives to annoy his brother.

        In early December, I will be getting married! We're excited to tie the
        knot, but equally excited to be honeymooning in Japan! We'll be
        exploring a handful of cities and immersing ourselves in Japanese
        culture. Plus, we can't wait to indulge in all the delicious food!

        Lately, I have been enjoying traveling the U.S.. I went to Yellowstone
        and Grand Teton for the first time last summer. Now, I am determined to
        visit most, if not all, U.S. National Parks in my lifetime.<br />On the
        off-season in winter, a large group of us go skiing/snowboarding for 3
        days to whichever mountain tickles our fancy. But at the end of this
        year during our honeymoon, we will be shredding down the mountains of
        Hokkaido!
